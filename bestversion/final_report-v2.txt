0.82-5.68: Happy Monday, it's Lynn with Iowa Dream Team Remax Concepts. I am out here at our lot listing in Adel.

5.82-9.62: Just wanted to walk you around and show you what it looks like on this beautiful fall day.

11.34-20.62: This lot is just under 3 acres. 2.14 I believe is buildable and the rest is among these trees.

20.72-24.96: I was hoping to show you more fall colors, but they are staying green this year.

24.96-29.82: This is about 8 miles from Waukee on the east side of Adel. No gravel.

30.00-37.36: No Covenant, no HOA. You can build with Ben Schulte Construction or bring your own builder.
